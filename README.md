# React Meme Editor

![React Meme Editor](meme-editor-preview.png)

## Description

React Meme Editor is a simple web application built with React, focusing on the usage of `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from the React library. The main purpose of this project is to allow users to select a random image of a famous internet meme and edit the text displayed on the top and bottom of the meme. The application demonstrates the use of `useState` to store and update the state of the meme object.

Please note that this project prioritizes functionality over aesthetics; the CSS has been minimally configured to make the site functional.

## Features

- Select a random meme image.
- Edit the text on the top and bottom of the meme using two text input boxes.
- Update the text as desired.

## Installation and Usage

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

  git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-meme-editor.git

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   
  cd react-meme-editor


4. Install the required dependencies:

  npm install


5. Start the development server:

  npm start
  
6. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the React Meme Editor application.

## How It Works

1. Upon loading the application, a random meme image will be displayed along with two text input boxes.
2. Enter the text you want to appear at the top and bottom of the meme in their respective input boxes.
3. The application uses `useState` to store the meme object's state, including the image URL and text.
4. As you type in the input boxes, the text on the meme will update in real-time, reflecting the changes made using `useState`.
5. You can update the text as many times as you want, and the meme will be updated accordingly.
